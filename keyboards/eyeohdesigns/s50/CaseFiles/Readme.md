# ATTENTION!

Please be aware I haven't had a chance to order these case files myself.  I'll be testing them out early July and I'll pull down this disclaimer then.  I've made plenty of acrylic style cases and have confidence in these files, but for the time being, order at your own risk.  [Here's](https://imgur.com/IlVzJfS) a picture of the case files aligned with each other and the PCB.
